Generate random matrix // maybe not random
Structure it to upper hessenberg
Run Thijs' code with a copy
Run mine with another copy
Compare accuracy and time // Talk to Weslley if this becomes difficult to time due to size and speed. Give to Weslley


3) Eigenvector computations for Real matrices
1) A just eigenvalue mode where we don't push past ilo igh (IE don't construct any unecessary parts of T)
2) Same interface as Thijs' (goal to have 1 interface that can switch between eispack/Thijs with opts)
4) Complex arithmetic (will need to build up from eispack ie extracting what block do and transcribe to TLAPACK operations)



0) ask julien for the name (constructs AD where A is dense and D is a vector representing a diagonal matrixal)
0b) Send compile.sh to Julien

test eigenvector on full A instead of upper Hessenberg
